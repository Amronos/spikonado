# Spikonado

Spikonado is a fully open-source omnidirectional robot built on the ROS 2 framework.

Extensive documentation has been written in the README.md and code of the various Spikonado packages included in this repository.
If you feel that something is missing and should be documented please create an issue. Pull requests are also welcome.

This project is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet fully functional or ready for general use.
Key features are still being implemented, and significant updates are expected.
As such, the project's usability will be limited.
Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome to help improve this robot.
